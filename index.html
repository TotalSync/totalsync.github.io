                I have begun working with a classmate on developing a cube satellite. As a step towards that end goal we have been researching satellite design. Additionally we will begin testing our solution by sending them into near space by weather ballon. We hope to launch our first attempt on January 22 2022.

            <h4>Boids</h4>
            <hr></hr>
            <p>
                Boids follow three basic rules. Adhesion, Cohesion, and Repulsion. These simple rules allow for complex behaviors to occur when many of these entities interact. Adhesion makes the boids want to try and stick together and go in the same direction as a neighboring boid. Cohesion makes the boids want to head towards a central point. Repulsion makes the boids not want to exist in the same location. By varying these three constants, different behaviors start to appear depending on the values. In the program I have created, you can edit these three variables by changing a constant and a scalar. I also included a pause button, primarily for debugging, but I decided to keep it, as it is a nice feature. I was introduced to the idea of boids by my roommate Danny.
            </p>
            <p>
                Danny worked on his version of the boids for a while, and I was intrigued by it, so I decided to take up that project as well. In the end, our projects ended up very different, as we were focused on very different parts of the project and we completed it in different ways. Danny created his project in a typical Object Oriented structure, while I created my version using the Entity, Component, System structure. After implementing the basic rules that the boids follow, (Cohesion, Repulsion, and Adhesion) I decided that it would be vert interesting to try and color the boids by the group that they were in. This lead to a number of issues as grouping the boids requires distance calculations between all boids. I began working on what I called the "inefficientGrouping()".
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal I wanted to accomplish through this algorithm was to be able to be able to easily distinguish the different groups of boids. To do this I had to make groups of boids by finding which boids were close together. If you have 10 boids, to find the distance between each boid, worst case scenario, is 10^10 (100) distance calculations. This number increase greatly as the number of boids increases. I was not just satisfied with grouping the boids together. I wanted there to be some logic to how the boids were grouped. I decided that if two groups combined, the larger group should stay dominate, and the smaller group would join the larger group. Adding logic similar to this to the grouping algorithm proved to be quite a nightmare, as there were many edge cases I had to take into account. In the end, the results were quite surprising. I managed to create a grouping algorithm that could handle 1000 boids before a noticeable performance drop. The algorithm can handle 2500 boids, but only at a framerate of below 20 frames per second.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately there are still some bugs that I have not been able to squash in my algorithm. Sometimes groups will split, but will still be a part of the same group. I have been unable to determine why this behavior exists. With school ramping back up, I have decided to lay this project to rest for the time being. A link to the project is in the Nav bar at the top of the page.

                I was born and raised in Wilmington North Carolina. I have always been interested in circuits from a young age. I used to look at older circuit boards and think about them like tiny cities.  Mythbusters was a great help in continuing to grow this interest. Around middle school I began to pursue the idea of becoming an engineer. I attended the science fair on three occasions, and earned an honorable mention at the North Carolina State Science Fair. I began taking apart things to try and figure out how they worked. I was originally fascinated by the mechanical components of machines, however, that changed when I joined my local First Robotics Team: 4534 The Wired Wizards. When I saw the robot for the first time, I understood how it worked mechanically, but I was fascinated by how it could be controlled from a long range. At that point I began to learn, in earnest, the basics of electricity.

                I worked with my team over three years during highschool to help design, build, run, and fix our robots over the course of a competition season. The First Robotics Competition (FRC) I participated in were Stronghold, Steamworks, and PowerUp. I learned many things while in my team. I learned how to communicate and work professionally while under the stresses of a competitive environment. In my final year, I was given the opportunity to be the leader of the design team for our entire team. In this position, it was my job ot oversee the design process and later in the build process, to make sure that the parts created were adhering to the design. The image on the right is our Robot Susan which was made for First Steamworks.
